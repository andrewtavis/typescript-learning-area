## TypeScript versions of the MDN JavaScript examples

**typescript-learning-area** is a GitHub repo with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) examples based on the [Mozilla Developer Network Learning Area](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn). The [typescript directory](https://github.com/andrewtavis/typescript-learning-area/tree/main/typescript) of this repo mirrors the [javascript directory](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/tree/master/javascript) of [mdn/learning-area](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area) with JS converted to valid TS, and all solutions modularized with script directories and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) based styling. The goal is to provide a reference that allows people to also learn TypeScript at MDN.

Contributions to improve the TS conversions are welcome! Conversions of MDN JS examples that have yet to be finished would also be helpful.
