# typescript-learning-area

GitHub repo for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) versions for the [MDN Learning Area](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn). A clone of the JavaScript directory of [mdn/learning-area](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area) with all JS converted to error free TS, and all solutions modularized with script directories and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) based styling. The directories in this repo match the module structure of the articles and original repo.

Contributions to improve the TypeScript are more than welcome!
