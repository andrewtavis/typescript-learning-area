### TypeScript versions of the MDN JavaScript examples

**typescript-learning-area** is a GitHub repo with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) examples based on the [Mozilla Developer Network Learning Area](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn). The [typescript directory](https://github.com/andrewtavis/typescript-learning-area/tree/main/typescript) of this repo mirrors the [javascript directory](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/tree/master/javascript) of [mdn/learning-area](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area) with JS converted to valid TS, and all solutions modularized with script directories and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) based styling. The goal is to provide a reference that allows people to also learn TypeScript at MDN.

Contributions to improve the TS conversions are welcome! Adding examples would also be helpful. New examples could include conversions of other MDN JS examples (the output should be the same), as well as modified or novel examples that demonstrate TS features.
